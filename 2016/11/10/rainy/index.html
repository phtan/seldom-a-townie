And at the same time he doesn’t even know where to begin with his own body: 
he watches 
sports on television and defends himself saying that everyone else does it too."

  <p>I’m suffering. They are suffering.</p>

<p>How to put an end to suffering? For myself.</p>

<p>Others can try out my methods if they want.</p>

<p>And of course they have to find out their own way.</p>

<p>Kodo Suzuki Roshi said that adults have to become like children, and children have to become like adults,
for children to grow. Apparently, he said that.</p>

<p>If I were a foster parent of all these lovable children in the world, my impending death is something
I have to deal with. Preparations have to be made for other people to help all these children grow,
so that my death will not stop their growth.</p>

<p>Yes, as Jobs said, death means having to tell your children what you thought you would
have the rest of your life so tell.</p>

<p>THere is a temple called Antaiji in Japan. The people there practice zazen that is good for nothing.</p>

<p>There is a person who is helping people to find a suitable livelihood. She also practises Zen. Her
book is a work-in-progress. It is predicted to be published in Fall 2017. Her name is Maia Duerr.</p>

<p>There are people who teach Zen in Singapore. Their names are Vivienne and Boey Wah Keong.</p>

<p>They will do what I amy not have the time to do. At least, they can do what I may run out of time to do.</p>

<p>Zazen is good for nothing. It is the way to liberate-save suffering people-human. Suzuki Roshi 
said that.</p>
