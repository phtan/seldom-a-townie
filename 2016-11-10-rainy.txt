I'm suffering. They are suffering.

How to put an end to suffering? For myself.

And of course they have to find out their own way.

Kodo Suzuki Roshi said that adults have to become like children, and children have to become like adults,
for children to grow. Apparently, he said that.

If I were a foster parent of all these lovable children in the world, my impending death is something
I have to deal with. Preparations have to be made for other people to help all these children grow,
so that my death will not stop their growth.

Yes, as Jobs said, death means having to tell your children what you thought you would
have the rest of your life so tell.

THere is a temple called Antaiji in Japan. The people there practice zazen that is good for nothing.

There is a person who is helping people to find a suitable livelihood. She also practises Zen. Her
book is a work-in-progress. It is predicted to be published in Fall 2017. Her name is Maia Duerr.

There are people who teach Zen in Singapore. Their names are Vivienne and Boey Wah Keong.

They will do what I amy not have the time to do. At least, they can do what I may run out of time to do.

Zazen is good for nothing. It is the way to liberate-save suffering people-human. Suzuki Roshi 
said that.
