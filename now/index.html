  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This is my proverbial jump onto the band-wagon of the <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">“now page”</a>,
which <a href="https://sivers.org/now3">Mr. Derek Sivers wrote about</a>.</p>

<h3 id="now">Now</h3>

<p>As of the date 4th October 2018 A.D., I’m engaged in part-time employment
in the kitchen of a restaurant of “Italian casual dining”.</p>

<p>I decided to work part-time instead of full-time because I still want to
commit to volunteering. What kind of volunteering? I am helping out with
the administrative tasks of running a soup kitchen, of sorts, for migrant-workers
in Singapore. I am volunteering with a non-profit organisation. 
More info <a href="http://twc2.org.sg/what-we-do/cuff-road-food-programme/">here</a></p>

<p>What makes me want to do the above?</p>

<p>I want to please my god, so both of the efforts above are what I feel called
to do after reading the Bible, where I can find out about what my god likes
and doesn’t like.</p>
