  <h1 class="page-title">What I am up to now</h1>
  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This is my proverbial jump onto the band-wagon of the <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">“now page”</a>,
which <a href="https://sivers.org/now3">Mr. Derek Sivers wrote about</a>.</p>

<h3 id="now">Now</h3>

<p>As of the date 14th November 2018 A.D., I’m engaged in part-time employment
in the kitchen of a restaurant of “Italian casual dining”.</p>

<p>I decided to work part-time instead of full-time because I still want to
commit to volunteering. What kind of volunteering? I am helping out with
the administrative tasks of running a soup kitchen, of sorts, for migrant-workers
in Singapore. I am volunteering with a non-profit organisation. 
More info <a href="http://twc2.org.sg/what-we-do/cuff-road-food-programme/">here</a></p>

<p>What makes me want to do the above?</p>

<p>I want to please <a href="http://phtan.github.io/religion.html">my god</a>, 
so both of the efforts above are what I feel called
to do after reading the Bible, where I can find out about what my god likes
and doesn’t like.</p>

<p>I’ve discovered that art (as in art-making) helps me process my experiences,
including emotions and states of being, and in this direction, I’ve made
a few paintings and put them up for sale 
(on <a href="https://tonychen.bigcartel.com">an online store</a>).</p>

<p>I want to stay tuned to the mystery behind (the impulse and/or need of)
art-making - this means I have to maintain a position/stance of patience, and even
surrender, to see what comes up and when it comes up.</p>

<p>I entrust this matter,
as with all matters in my life, to my god, who is good, and whose ways are
blameless.</p>

<p>More concretely, this means being aware - developing an intuition, even - for
what feeds my art - as an aside, perhaps, this is perhaps related to the 
somewhat unsavoury character that has been attributed to artists in general,
such as Hesse’s portrayal of an artist-womaniser in the fictional story
of 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5954.Narcissus_and_Goldmund">‘Narcissus and Goldmund’</a> - 
and giving myself permission to pursue it/those,
whatever it/they may be.</p>

<p>Somewhat related to my paintings are a visual journal that I am maintaining
(and hosting <a href="https://trust-in-jehovah.tumblr.com">on Tumblr</a>). It’s been
suggested to me, by <a href="http://mira-yoon.format.com">an art-therapist</a>, 
to keep one; if my god is willing, it will
be inspiration that a future me could come across.</p>
