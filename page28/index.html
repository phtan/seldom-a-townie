    <p>The exclamation in the title of this post came from a street-busker I have met,
a number of years ago. He was commenting on the quality of music-playing
that came from young musicians nowadays.</p>

<p>“What is ‘flower’?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Flower? Flower is this!” he replied, before launching into a song, on his
guitar, which I couldn’t help but dance to.</p>

<p>So what is flower? I couldn’t help but to want to have a more theoretical,
or even academic, perspective on the terminology of this street-busker.</p>

<p>Finally, years later, with glory to my god - and thanks to Him, of course - I found a mention
in a book called “Nine gates: Entering the mind of poetry” by Jane Hirshfield.</p>

<p>Hirshfield mentioned the concept of <em>hana</em> in a form of 
Japanese theatre called Nō. Supposedly, <em>hana</em> - which, interestingly enough,
means ‘flower’ in the Japanese language - is the quality by which an actor
can move the audience, despite being hidden behind a mask and standing motionless
on stage. Supposedly (according to the claims of Hirshfield, who in turn
was quoting a practitioner or observer of Nō), <em>hana</em> can be accessed 
sometimes in youth, but in maturity, <em>hana</em>… - oh, I forget what Hirshfield
wrote.</p>

<p>Perhaps this might be interesting enough for me to investigate further.</p>
