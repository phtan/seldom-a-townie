  <p>I feel rewarded for getting up earlier than usual today - 
<a href="https://www.hnworth.com/article/truths/life/why-i-started-stage-6-a-conscious-co-living-space/">Helena Wasserman Eriksson</a>
 ‘s talk was scheduled for 8.30 AM.</p>

<p><a href="https://creativemornings.com/talks/helena-wasserman-eriksson-on-invest">Her talk</a>, 
on the topic “Invest”, began with questions for the audience. Then: “I want you to think how you have invested in yourself, and the great feeling you had when you did that. Then take 5 minutes to share it with your neighbour.”</p>

<p>If I think about it now, attending her talk was an investment in myself, too. And I think this investment has paid off already - at the talk’s venue, I met people, who not only seemed to share similar interests with me, but also seem to be better than myself at it. For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugeneseancheng/">Eugene Cheng</a> has done photography at weddings, something I haven’t done (yet), but it’s something which Eugene asserts will provide lots of opportunities to develop photographic skills</li>
  <li>Tsuyumi Miwa ‘s name-cards feature her paintings on the reverse side - an idea I can consider if I do start making name-cards for my artistic practice. (Tsuyumi-san’s website: http://heymiwa.com/ )</li>
  <li>I met someone who talked about one’s posture, in relation to pain in one’s knees, while running. Now I am thinking about whether my posture, while I use my laptop, is the best for my body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lots of food for thought, to say the least!</p>
