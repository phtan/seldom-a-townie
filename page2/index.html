        A new way? nineteenth of March 2018: Night

    <p>When did it become an assumption that I have to have a password on the 
Internet or even my desktop-computer? I was inspired to think if 
something has gone wrong, in the design of Internet-and-computer 
technologies, when I realised that an engineering problem - how to 
display certain information on a web-site - could possibly be solved by 
letting users run commands on the server (as opposed as viewing data on 
a client) Passwords, levels of privilege, ‘admininistrator-rights’ - 
don’t all these scream ‘I don’t trust you. I don’t trust others’ Now is 
that what I want in my life, I ask. Do I want to indirectly say ‘I don’t 
trust others’ every time I use a technology. Or do I want to spend time 
building (trust in) relationships that arguably are made and broken by 
(mutual) trust. Does using technology necessarily mean that I have to 
give up on trust and/or trust-building. Is it possible we could find a 
new way to use technology so that we find the satisfaction (and 
intimacy) that comes from a rewarding relationship with a something. A 
god. A business-partner. So on and so forth.</p>
