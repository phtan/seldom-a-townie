    <h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>I was a little reluctant to share the locations of these places - since
I have begun to regard them as little treasures for me to view quietly - 
but I am instructed by the teacher Christ Jesus to not stock up on treasures
of this world.</p>

<p>In Matthew 6:19-20, he tells us:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust
 destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, 
where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do 
not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there
 your heart will be also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, in Luke 12:32-34:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the 
kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to the poor. 
Provide yourselves with purses that will not wear out, an 
inexhaustible treasure in heaven, where no thief approaches and
 no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-spaces-that-by-the-way-seem-a-little-less-touristy-to-me">The spaces (that, by the way, seem a little less touristy to me)</h3>

<p>So, in the hopes that my god is pleased, I list a number of art-galleries below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cape of Good Hope Art Gallery.
Address: 231 Bain Street, Bras Basah Complex, #03-17, Singapore 180231.</li>
  <li>DLR Gallery.
Address: 22 Marshall Road,
Singapore 424858. <em>To visit, please call +65 9772 7852 or +65 9296 0031.</em></li>
  <li>Parkview Museum. Address: 600 North Bridge Road, 
Parkview Square, Level 3, Singapore 188778.</li>
  <li>The Private Museum. Address: 51 Waterloo Street, #02-06,
Singapore 187969.</li>
</ol>

<p>A quick search on an online search-engine would, if G!d is willing, reveal the 
contact-numbers of these spaces and/or further information.</p>
