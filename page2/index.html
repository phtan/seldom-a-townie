        Q&A for me

    <time datetime="2020-04-05T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">05 Apr 2020</time>

    <p>I love reading interviews. Whether it is an interview of Kevin Ma, founder
of the magazine known as Hypebeast, or <a href="https://sivers.org/2015-12-ferriss">an interview of Derek Sivers</a>, entrepreneur
who reportedly said No to selling his business for millions of dollars,
I get to find out a bit more about these people.</p>

<p>So, one day, I thought, how about I interview myself? Then others can find
out more about me. [chuckles].</p>

<p>But… what would I ever ask myself?</p>

<p>Thankfully, I found some questions that were addressed to the public, on
the social-network web-site known as LinkedIn, and guess what, I answered them!</p>

<p>And now, I collect my answers to those questions, in this blog-post! Ta-dah!
I have an interview… of myself! (Although others asked those questions).</p>

<p>[clears throat]. Let’s start the interview!</p>

<p><strong>How are you challenging yourself in 2020? - Elisha</strong></p>

<p>My challenge for myself so far, in 2020, is to balance my time on social media - or, more broadly speaking, my time on an electronic computing device - with my time off the Internet. It would be interesting to see how I can do this in the light of a trend towards webinar(s) and work-from-home, set against a background of virus-news, virus-concerns, virus-fretting, virus-worrying and virus-scares.</p>

<p><strong>What has been one project or assignment in which you broke the rules and had fun in the creative process? - Joseph</strong></p>

<p>I once took an undergraduate-course on Composing Music in the Classical Style (for example, in the style of Mozart). For an assignment in that course, I wrote a musical work that appears to be thoroughly twentieth-century, instead of looking eighteenth-century. My course-instructor did not accept my work, but I still had fun. (I’ve realised the importance of surrounding myself with people who value creativity and innovation - which is not everyone, and I certainly don’t really appreciate flattery and/or smooth talk, either).</p>

<p><strong>Tell me what is your oops-boo-hoo moment this week, and what you learnt from it. - Phing</strong></p>

<p>An “oops-boo-hoo” of mine, as you call it? I run a blog where I post photos from my trips to art-galleries in Sg. Art-hunting, if you will. But I got a 
little lost; something didn’t feel right (about such blogging) anymore. I 
asked the person known, on LinkedIn.com , as Alin Sneha Abraham, for her perspective on the matter; I said I wasn’t sure if my blogging was adding value to the world. Alin said something to the effect that it is more important that I enjoy myself; that way, at least one person benefits. So my oops-boo-hoo was to overlook my own enjoyment of the activity in question. I concluded that I liked visiting galleries, but posting photos on social media? Not so much.</p>
