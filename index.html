        Places, in Singapore, where I have had wine for about SGD$10

    <p>From what I remember, a can of beer, bought from a convenience store, costs
more in Singapore than in Taipei, the capital-city of Taiwan, so maybe
the price of a glass of wine is more expensive in Singapore than in Taipei, too,
if not elsewhere.</p>

<p>Having said that, I have somewhat frequented the following establishments,
during so-called ‘happy hours’; the price comes up to SGD$10 to SGD$11 for a 
glass, at the most. I list the price of a glass of wine, whether it be red or white:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/bruno-s-pizzeria-grill/">Bruno’s Bistrot/Pizzaria &amp; Grill</a>. $7.50, exclusive of a ‘service charge’ of 10%. All operation-hours are ‘happy hour’, I’ve heard. A plus maybe: bottles of wine are stored openly (that is, visibly) in a chiller for that purpose. <em>544 Serangoon Road, Singapore 218166</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hejthere.com">Hej Kitchen &amp; Bar</a>. ‘Happy hours’: 12 PM to 7 PM - it’s not clear to me whether these are for weekdays, weekends, or both.  $8, exclusive of service charge (10%) and GST (7%). <em>​180 Orchard Road, Singapore 238846</em>. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OAGjcoN.jpg" alt="Signboard that displays the prices of alcoholic beverages during 'happy hours' at the bar Hej" title="Happy hours at the bar Hej" /></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.theboiler.com.sg/contact-us">The Boiler (at the structure Esplanade)</a>. ‘Happy hours’: 5.30 PM to 8.30 PM, daily maybe. $8.50, exclusive of Service Charge and GST. <em>8 Raffles Ave, #01-13A, Esplanade Mall, Singapore 039802.</em> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/m9a3hYn.jpg" alt="Information on so-called 'Happy Hour' at a restaurant called The Boiler" title="Information on Happy Hours at the restaurant The Boiler" /></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d2538704-Reviews-Steakout-Singapore.html">Steakout</a>. ‘Happy hours’: Sunday to Thursday, excluding public holidays and their eves. $2 off the regular price of wine - this works out to be approximately $10. <em>89 Victoria Street, #01-01, Victoria Hotel, Singapore 188017</em>. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/27VXANQ.jpg" alt="A sign-board upon which the prices of various alcoholic beverages are written, pertaining to so-called 'Happy Hours' at the restaurant Steakout" title="Information on 'Happy Hours' at the restaurant Steakout" /></li>
