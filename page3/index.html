        What I learnt in Computer Science
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2018-10-30T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">30 Oct 2018</time>

    <p>I dropped out from an undergraduate course in Computer Science (CS, for short).</p>

<p>While I was attending CS courses, however, I learnt how to detach myself, or abstract
myself, from technological tools, which, as a so-called ‘digital native’ may
know, changes ever so frequently.</p>

<p>I learnt that if I have a fundamental skill, or what
 <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~bleong/">(one of)</a> 
my lecturer(s)
called ‘first principles’, I can solve a given problem, regardless of how
seemingly foreign the problem may be.</p>

<p>Applying this concept in another context, it could be said that if I know
the fundamental skills in social dealings, then regardless of which country,
or culture, I find myself in, I can thrive (and not merely survive - but
that’s a topic for another time, perhaps).</p>

<p>That’s powerful. That’s empowering. (As the saying goes, “Give a man a fish,
and you feed him once. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a life-time.”)
And it gives one confidence. It
certainly gives me confidence.</p>

<p>But of course I credit all these lessons and benefits, or perks, to 
<a href="http://phtan.github.io/religion.html">my god</a> and his kindness and goodness.</p>
