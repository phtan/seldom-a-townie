        Content warning: emotional blackmail

    <p>Content warning: emotional blackmail.</p>

<p>“If you don’t do what I want you 
to, I’ll kill myself.”</p>

<p>My mother said that to me when I was ten years 
old or younger. Yes, my mother. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t even 
think to call the police. My siblings - a younger brother and a younger 
sister - were there as well.</p>

<p>“Well? Do you want me to jump down from 
nine storeys high, or not? Shall I do it now?”</p>

<p>My brother and I refused 
to give in. But my sister rushed to Mummy and said, sobbing: “I love 
you, Mummy, please don’t jump.”</p>

<p>Fast forward to my fifteen-year-old 
self: I came in first in my cohort, in academic performance.</p>

<p>At 
twenty-three years old: I felt unwell (mentally or otherwise). My 
university class-mates started avoiding me.</p>

<p>Now, at thirty years old: 
Looking back, it was hardly surprising that I suffered a break-down. I 
had to attend to my wounds - emotional or otherwise - from my childhood. 
All those years, I had been avoiding it, pretending everything was fine. 
Now I feel much better, thanks to a Biblical God. And I wish - and 
practise - kindness towards my mother, because that’s what my god wants.</p>

<p>If you’re suffering similarly right now, I hope my message encourages 
you.</p>
