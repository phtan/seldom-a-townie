   <title>A new way? nineteenth of March 2018: Night</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When did it become an assumption that I have to have a password on the 
Internet or even my desktop-computer? I was inspired to think if 
something has gone wrong, in the design of Internet-and-computer 
technologies, when I realised that an engineering problem - how to 
display certain information on a web-site - could possibly be solved by 
letting users run commands on the server (as opposed as viewing data on 
a client) Passwords, levels of privilege, ‘admininistrator-rights’ - 
don’t all these scream ‘I don’t trust you. I don’t trust others’ Now is 
that what I want in my life, I ask. Do I want to indirectly say ‘I don’t 
trust others’ every time I use a technology. Or do I want to spend time 
building (trust in) relationships that arguably are made and broken by 
(mutual) trust. Does using technology necessarily mean that I have to 
give up on trust and/or trust-building. Is it possible we could find a 
new way to use technology so that we find the satisfaction (and 
intimacy) that comes from a rewarding relationship with a something. A 
god. A business-partner. So on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m suffering. They are suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to put an end to suffering? For myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others can try out my methods if they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course they have to find out their own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodo Suzuki Roshi said that adults have to become like children, and children have to become like adults,
for children to grow. Apparently, he said that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were a foster parent of all these lovable children in the world, my impending death is something
I have to deal with. Preparations have to be made for other people to help all these children grow,
so that my death will not stop their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, as Jobs said, death means having to tell your children what you thought you would
have the rest of your life so tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THere is a temple called Antaiji in Japan. The people there practice zazen that is good for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a person who is helping people to find a suitable livelihood. She also practises Zen. Her
book is a work-in-progress. It is predicted to be published in Fall 2017. Her name is Maia Duerr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people who teach Zen in Singapore. Their names are Vivienne and Boey Wah Keong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will do what I amy not have the time to do. At least, they can do what I may run out of time to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zazen is good for nothing. It is the way to liberate-save suffering people-human. Suzuki Roshi 
said that.&lt;/p&gt;
