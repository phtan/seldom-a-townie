  <h3 id="a-story">A story</h3>

<p>On the <a href="http://youtu.be/Boc7GZ86Qag">28th of October, 2016 A.D.</a>,
I bought <a href="http://litherecords.bandcamp.com/album/lithe001-qu-sub-shaman-ilm-split-ep">a cassette tape</a>
at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/litheparalogue">Lithe House</a>.</p>

<p>
On the evening of the same day, as I distractedly looked at the cassette
tape, on the bus home, wondering if the cassette deck at my house was still
functional, I looked up to see a stranger smiling at me.
</p>
<p>
He and I exchanged a few glances. Later, he invited me to his house.
</p>
<p>
Another evening, at his house, he passed a few more cassette tapes to me.
</p>
<p>
Will someone value the cassette tapes more than I do?
</p>
<p>
Out of curiosity, I am experimenting with a swap to see what value cassette tapes
have in a world where technology changes. There will be no money involved.
What would people offer in exchange for these tapes?
</p>
<p>
I didn't want to swap, until the cassette tapes started to gather dust
at my father's house. Will there be a better use for them?
</p>
<p>
This effort will last for forty-five days, beginning from 9th November,
2016 A.D.

<h3 id="a-few-cassette-tapes">A few cassette tapes</h3>
<p>
Details of the cassette tapes are available at
<a href="http://carousell.com/phtan90">a shop at Carousell</a>
</p>

<p>
An attempt to catalogue cassette tapes, that are located in Singapore,
is viewable at
<a href="http://en.sgtapes.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">a wiki</a>
</p>

<h3 id="results-of-the-experiment">Results of the experiment</h3>

<p>As of 7th October 2018 A.D., I have sold zero of the cassette tapes from
the experimental swap.</p>

<p>I note the following that occurred during the experiment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Approached more than five sellers - if I recall correctly - to see if
they wanted to sell their tapes through the <a href="http://en.sgtapes.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a> 
that I had set up. Those sellers had been selling through an e-commerce platform.</li>
  <li>Agreed to help one seller list his tape on the wiki; he claims he did not know how to use that wiki. He is the only seller on that wiki, other than me, as it turns out (as of 7th October 2018 A.D.)</li>
  <li>Got banned from logging into my account on the afore-mentioned e-commerce platform; its staff claim I was “touting” and they do not allow touting.
