<h2>A story</h2>

<p>
On the <a href="http://youtu.be/Boc7GZ86Qag">28th of October, 2016 A.D.</a>,
I bought <a href="http://litherecords.bandcamp.com/album/lithe001-qu-sub-shaman-ilm-split-ep">a cassette tape</a>
at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/litheparalogue">Lithe House</a>.
</p>
<p>
On the evening of the same day, as I distractedly looked at the cassette
tape, on the bus home, wondering if the cassette deck at my house was still
functional, I looked up to see a stranger smiling at me.
</p>
<p>
He and I exchanged a few glances. Later, he invited me to his house.
</p>
<p>
Another evening, at his house, he passed a few more cassette tapes to me.
</p>
<p>
Will someone value the cassette tapes more than I do?
</p>
<p>
Out of curiosity, I am experimenting with a swap to see what value cassette tapes
have in a world where technology changes. There will be no money involved.
What would people offer in exchange for these tapes?
</p>
<p>
I didn't want to swap, until the cassette tapes started to gather dust
at my father's house. Will there be a better use for them?
</p>
<p>
This effort will last for forty-five days, beginning from 9th November,
2016 A.D.
